"""Agent roster — attribution for each stage of the audit pipeline.

Every AgentEvent carries this attribution so the UI can show *which agent* did
*what* with *which tool*. Both runners (FakeRunner and RealRunner) import from
here so the scripted demo and the live case tell the same story.

Labels are honest about the implementation: vector search and aggregation execute
through the official MongoDB MCP server; the policy / duplicate / ghost-vendor /
off-hours detectors are internal tools operating on data read from Atlas; OFAC is
a live US Treasury feed; plan + narrative come from Gemini 3 on Vertex AI.
